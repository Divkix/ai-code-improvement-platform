# Error Report: Repository Import Pipeline Failure

**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Unresolved  
**Reporter:** Divkix  
**Investigation Lead:** Claude Code Assistant  

## Issue Summary

The repository import pipeline is completely non-functional. When users add GitHub repositories through the frontend interface, repositories are created in the database with "pending" status but the file import process never triggers automatically. Manual attempts to trigger the import process fail due to GitHub token decryption errors.

## Symptoms

1. **Primary Issue**: Repositories remain stuck at "Preparing import..." with 0% progress indefinitely
2. **Manual Trigger Failure**: External attempts to trigger import fail with "failed to decrypt GitHub token" 
3. **No Automatic Processing**: Repository creation does not trigger the expected `processRepositoryImport` goroutine
4. **Search Functionality Broken**: 404 errors when attempting to search (no code chunks exist due to failed import)

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Investigation

**Expected Flow:**
```
Frontend → Add Repository → POST /api/repositories → CreateRepository → Auto-trigger Import → processRepositoryImport → Files Fetched → Chunks Stored → Status: Ready
```

**Actual Flow:**
```
Frontend → Add Repository → POST /api/repositories → CreateRepository → Repository Created → [STOPS HERE] → Status: Pending Forever
```

### Key Findings

1. **Repository Creation Works**: Repositories are successfully created in MongoDB with correct metadata
2. **GitHub OAuth Works**: Users can connect GitHub accounts and tokens are stored (encrypted)
3. **Backend Services Operational**: MongoDB ✅, Qdrant ✅, Embedding Workers ✅
4. **Import Pipeline Code Exists**: The `processRepositoryImport` method is implemented with full functionality
5. **Auto-trigger Logic Failing**: The automatic import trigger is not activating

### Database Evidence

```javascript
// Repository exists but never processes
{
  _id: ObjectId('6881308b49ade8ebc2bfb9cc'),
  userId: ObjectId('68812f64e526fb097e1703b0'),
  fullName: 'Divkix/poetry-export-requirements-action', 
  status: 'pending',
  importProgress: 0,
  createdAt: ISODate('2025-07-23T18:52:34.237Z')
}

// No code chunks exist - confirming import never ran
db.codechunks.countDocuments({}) // Returns: 0

// User has valid GitHub token
{
  githubToken: '42LZxbaJv+H7Il/rBfHy1vUZZIIxvitpOJtmc2+taNZ/oJZQAhHCfg0/f6mmPvh+ZO4iUxa3Rum0/bBJCku4HdkRXe4=',
  githubUsername: 'Divkix'
}
```

### Code Analysis

**Issue 1: Auto-trigger Logic Gap**
The `CreateRepository` method in `repository.go:49-75` creates repositories but has no automatic import trigger for GitHub repositories.

**Issue 2: Token Decryption Problem**
Manual trigger attempts fail with:
```
Failed to trigger repository import: failed to decrypt GitHub token
```

**Issue 3: Frontend/Backend Communication Gap**
The frontend may be calling the wrong API endpoint or the repository creation flow is not designed to handle GitHub imports.

## Attempted Fixes

### Fix Attempt 1: Auto-trigger Implementation (FAILED)
- **Action**: Added `autoTriggerGitHubImport` method to automatically start import after repository creation
- **Code Changes**: Modified `CreateRepository` to detect GitHub repos and trigger import
- **Result**: FAILED - Import still not triggered
- **Why Failed**: Logic depends on `repo.GitHubRepoID != nil` but this field may not be populated by frontend

### Fix Attempt 2: Manual Trigger Utility (FAILED)
- **Action**: Created external test utility to manually trigger import
- **Code Changes**: Added `TriggerRepositoryImport` method with token decryption
- **Result**: FAILED - Token decryption errors
- **Why Failed**: Encryption key mismatch between container and external process

### Fix Attempt 3: Manual Database Fixes (FAILED)
- **Action**: Deleted stuck repositories and recreated to test fresh import
- **Result**: FAILED - Same issue persists with new repositories

## Current Status

- **Repositories**: 1 stuck in pending status
- **Code Chunks**: 0 (no files have been processed)
- **User Impact**: Complete inability to analyze any code repositories
- **Search**: Non-functional (404 errors due to no indexed content)

## Architecture Problems Identified

1. **Missing Import Trigger**: Repository creation doesn't automatically start file processing
2. **Token Management Issues**: GitHub token encryption/decryption inconsistencies  
3. **Frontend Integration Gap**: Unclear what API endpoint frontend should call for GitHub imports
4. **No Recovery Mechanism**: No way to restart failed imports through UI
5. **Insufficient Logging**: Hard to debug what's happening during repository creation

## Impact Assessment

**User Impact:** CRITICAL
- Users cannot analyze any repositories
- Core application functionality is broken
- No workaround available through UI

**Business Impact:** HIGH  
- Product is essentially non-functional for its primary use case
- Demo scenarios will fail
- User onboarding impossible

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Deep Dive Token Investigation**
   - Debug why GitHub token decryption fails
   - Compare encryption keys between container and external processes
   - Test token decryption directly in backend container context

2. **Frontend Flow Analysis**  
   - Trace exactly which API endpoints frontend calls when adding repositories
   - Verify request payloads contain necessary GitHub metadata
   - Check if frontend should call different endpoint for GitHub imports

3. **Import Pipeline Debug**
   - Add extensive logging to repository creation flow
   - Trace why auto-trigger logic isn't activating
   - Test import pipeline with known working tokens

### Medium-term Solutions

1. **Create Manual Recovery Endpoint**
   - Add `/api/repositories/{id}/import` endpoint to OpenAPI spec
   - Allow manual restart of stuck imports through UI
   - Implement proper error handling and status reporting

2. **Improve Architecture**
   - Separate generic repository creation from GitHub import flow
   - Create dedicated GitHub import endpoints
   - Add comprehensive status tracking and error reporting

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Add Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Track import success/failure rates
   - Alert on stuck repositories
   - Add health checks for import pipeline

2. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Show detailed import progress with logs
   - Provide retry mechanisms in UI
   - Add better error messages for users

## Files Modified During Investigation

- `/backend/internal/services/repository.go` - Added auto-trigger logic (failed)
- `/backend/internal/handlers/repository.go` - Added manual trigger handler
- `/backend/cmd/test-import/main.go` - Created debugging utility
- `/backend/api/openapi.yaml` - Attempted to add new endpoint (reverted)

## Conclusion

This is a critical architectural issue that prevents the core functionality of the application from working. The repository import pipeline, while implemented, is never triggered during the normal user flow. Multiple fix attempts have failed, indicating this requires a fundamental review of the repository creation and import architecture.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Requires immediate attention to make application functional.
